# vanDerMeer

< Work in progress >

vanDerMeer (meaning "of the lake") is a 100% open source data catalogue and governance application.

It is intended to allow data engineers to be able to provide an evergreen view of data held by your organisation within minutes, and to provide non-technical data owners, stewards and analysts access to the data they need, quickly.
